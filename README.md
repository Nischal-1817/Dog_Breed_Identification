# Dog_Breed_Identification

### Introduction 
> The basic idea of this project is to identify the breed of a dog from it's image using various technologies like [`Tensor flow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets) and `deep learning`. The data set contains images of 120 unique breeds and the number of images present in the data set are around 10,000. So, I have trained my [`Mobile net V2 model`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/5) with this data and now is able to be tested with various images.

### Data set
> The data set is taken from [kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) which is publicly accessible.
