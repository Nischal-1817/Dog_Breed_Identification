# Dog_Breed_Identification
* This repo is created to identify the breed of a dog from it's image. 
* The data set is taken from [kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification) which is publicly accessible.
* I have used [`Tensor flow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets) and `deep learning` for this project and the results are based on [`image net_mobile net V2`](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/5) model
